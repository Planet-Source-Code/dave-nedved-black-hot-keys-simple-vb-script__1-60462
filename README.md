## Black, Hot keys, Simple VB Script


</div>

### Description

The whole idea of this little prg is... Back when i was in school, the teachers went really NUTS @ us for doing stuff' on the computers... So i created this program to detect the keys 'Ctrl+Shift+~' when they are pressed the program displays a black screen, The idea of this is so it looks like the computer isn&#8217;t running... :) I have included a simple Bat setup, as well as VB Script help. Because the computers i ran it on back then didn&#8217;t have VB on them...

Um.. Yen I cant include a Screen shot; cause the program is a Black Screen...
 
### More Info
 
Plz leave ur Comments &amp; Votes cause I want 2 no if this program is any good 2 you all... DONT FORGET ITS BEGINNER CODE, not advanced, so take it ezy...
